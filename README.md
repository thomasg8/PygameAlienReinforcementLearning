# PygameReinforcementLearning
This project uses reinforcement learning to train an agent to play a custom game built in pygame. The game is a turn based game with an alient agent that has to dodge falling meteorites. The alien can only move left, none/up, or right, while the meteorites move down one row every turn. An example state is shown in 

To see the trained agent, run SimulationWithVisual.py. 

It was created under the advisement of Dr. Bonifonte during the Spring semester of 2019 at Denison University. Please read the corresponding paper titled ReinforcementLearninginPygame.pdf.
